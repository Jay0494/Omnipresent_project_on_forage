## Data cleaning and processing 
### Data Cleaning Process

To ensure the data integrity and reliability of the Omnipresent dataset, several meticulous data cleaning steps were performed. These processes are crucial for accurate analysis and deriving meaningful insights. The following steps outline the professional data cleaning procedures that were executed:

1. **Removal of Irrelevant Columns**:
   - Non-essential columns that do not contribute to the analysis were identified and removed, simplifying the dataset and focusing on the key performance metrics.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - **Removal**: Rows with substantial missing values were removed to prevent skewed analysis.
   - **Imputation**: Missing values in critical columns were filled using appropriate methods such as mean, median, or mode to ensure completeness of data.

3. **Formatting Columns and Data Types**:
   - Ensured all columns were correctly formatted, with specific attention to:
     - **Dates**: Converted to a standardized date format for consistency.
     - **Numerical Values**: Ensured numerical fields were accurately typed as integers or floats.
     - **Text Fields**: Standardized text fields for uniformity in data representation.

4. **Standardizing Data**:
   - Applied consistent formatting across all text fields, ensuring uniform use of upper/lower case and removing extraneous spaces.
   - Standardized categorical values to maintain consistency, such as normalizing different representations of similar data entries (e.g., “Yes” and “No” instead of multiple variations).

These data cleaning steps were meticulously carried out to enhance the quality of the dataset, ensuring it is well-prepared for detailed analysis and interpretation. This rigorous approach guarantees that subsequent analyses are based on accurate, complete, and standardized data.



## Analysis And Insights 
1. **Client Distribution**:
   - Streaming and technical support requests are the most common, followed closely by payment-related requests. This highlights areas where additional resources or focused efforts could be particularly beneficial.

2. **Call Time Periods**:
   - The afternoon period experiences the highest call volume. This indicates the need for optimized staffing levels and increased agent availability during this time to efficiently handle the peak in calls.

3. **Average Satisfaction Rating**:
   - The average satisfaction rating of 2.76, while decent, suggests there is significant room for improvement. Enhancing agent training and refining service processes could help boost customer satisfaction.

4. **Average Call Answering Speed**:
   - With an average answering speed of 54.75 seconds, the call response time is reasonable. However, further reducing this time could enhance the overall customer experience and satisfaction.

5. **Top Agent Performance**:
   - Jim stands out as the top-performing agent. His performance can serve as a benchmark for other agents, and understanding his approach could help elevate the overall team’s performance.

6. **Calls Resolved Percentage**:
   - The calls resolved percentage of 72.92% indicates that PhoneNow is successfully resolving the majority of customer issues, contributing positively to customer satisfaction.

7. **Calls Answered Percentage**:
   - An 81.08% call answer rate demonstrates that PhoneNow is effectively handling a significant portion of incoming calls, ensuring customer inquiries are promptly addressed.
  
## Recommendations 
1. **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**:
   - **Analyze Customer Feedback**: Conduct regular analysis of customer feedback to pinpoint specific areas needing improvement.
   - **Improve Agent Training**: Develop and implement targeted training programs to address identified weaknesses and enhance overall service quality.
   - **Process Improvements**: Streamline and optimize service processes to ensure faster and more efficient resolution of customer issues.

2. **Optimize Staffing During Peak Periods**:
   - **Adjust Staffing Levels**: Increase staffing during the afternoon, the busiest call period, to ensure adequate coverage and efficient call handling.
   - **Flexible Scheduling**: Implement flexible scheduling to match staffing levels with call volume trends, ensuring agents are available when needed most.

3. **Minimize Call Answering Speed**:
   - **Advanced Call Routing Systems**: Invest in advanced call routing technologies to direct calls to the most appropriate agents quickly, reducing wait times.
   - **Additional Staffing**: Consider hiring additional staff or employing part-time agents during peak periods to further reduce call answering times.

4. **Leverage Top Agent Performance**:
   - **Benchmarking**: Use Jim’s high performance as a benchmark. Analyze his methods and share best practices with the rest of the team.
   - **Mentorship Programs**: Establish mentorship programs where top-performing agents mentor others, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning.

5. **Focus on Resolution Rates**:
   - **Enhance Knowledge Base**: Improve the resources and tools available to agents, such as a comprehensive knowledge base, to aid in resolving issues effectively on the first call.
   - **Regular Performance Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of agent performance focusing on resolution rates, providing feedback and additional training where necessary.
   - **Incentives for High Resolution Rates**: Implement incentive programs to reward agents with high resolution rates, encouraging a focus on effective issue resolution.

6. **Maintain High Call Answer Rates**:
   - **Regular Process Optimization**: Continuously review and optimize call handling processes to maintain or improve the high call answer rate.
   - **Monitoring and Reporting**: Establish a robust monitoring and reporting system to quickly identify and address any declines in call answer rates.
   - **Customer Callback Options**: Offer customers the option to request a callback during peak times, ensuring all inquiries are addressed even if immediate response isn’t possible.

## Conclusion 
By implementing these recommendations, Omnipresent can enhance its customer service operations, improve agent performance, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction levels.
